## Instructions

The first screen will show a Floating Action Button with a prompt that
says "add account." Click this, and it will take you to the Plaid Link Interface.
You can choose any of the listed banks, the credentials are all the same.
Enter "user_good" for username and "pass_good" for password, then click continue.
This should log you in and take you to a screen that asks you to select accounts
for review. It actually doesn't matter which you select- they will all be imported
by the project, I have not implemented selective data pulling yet.
This should take you back to an overall view of the accounts. Click on any one 
of these to see another screen with account details, transactions, and graphical
analyzers.
