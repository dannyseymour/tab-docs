## Intended Users

Tab can be used by anyone who has recurring bills that need to be paid; however, the app
is specifically designed for those with limited to no credit history looking to build up a
ledger of small payments, potentially finance some of those payments, and enter into the mainstream
financial environment by building a solid base.

## User Stories
I am a student out of college renting my first home. I am picking up shifts as an Uber 
Driver and need help with uncertain cash flows to make rent and bill payments. As a User, I need
to pull data from my past payments and show that I have income sufficient to cover my current payments.

I am a single mother who is struggling to build credit history due to fluctuating expenses on a mostly fixed income.
Because I have had trouble making bill payments in the past, my only option to cover rent, bills, and other unexpected expenses
is with payday loans. As a user, Tab allows me to access short-term financing which takes into account my financial situation, secures the loan
against a pledge from my employer to pay, and helps me build up a history of on-time payments.

I am an elderly person living on Social Security. Because my income is fixed and predictable, I can tell my app exactly when I can get paid and how much-
but unfortunately the bill collectors don't always align their schedules with mine. As a user looking to keep my finances straight and predictable,
I would like to link up Tab to recognize my past income and predict its regularity, and judge the credit risk of a microloan for my bills accordingly.
