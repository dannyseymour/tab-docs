## User Experience
Users log in to Tab via their Android phones. By connecting the app to their bank and bill payment accounts
(accomplished via connecting to the Yodlee API), the app provides a simple bill payment screen that can access
credit cards or Google Pay (connected to the user's login).

The key differentiator of the app is the ability for a "microtab." Since the app can access a user's 
history of payments and income, it can asses "microrisk" and offer a small loan to help with timely bill payment.
If the user grants access to account history, the app looks at income history (such as recurring paycheck income, history
of bill payments, recurring expenses, habits, etc) and assess the risk on a small loan- a more granular approach
to lending and credit risk than is typically offered by financial institutions. If Tab receives information that you
owe a bill on Mondayfor your phone, for example, but that you typically get paid every friday, it can assess the risk
of a four-day loan to make timely bill payment. This is the "put it on my tab," feature. The loan payment
will be automatically deducted from the next paycheck.

A separate menu shows a list of overdue payments, how far they are overdue, and uses a color-coded 
system to show the user how much they are hurting their credit, and offers terms to make payments on their tab. The user can swipe the line items to go straight to a payment screen. Color code for effect on credit?

Over time, a user will build up history with Tab based on successful tab payments- creating a "microcredit" score
that can be combined with the user's official credit score to make a more robust analysis of that user's ability
and willingness to repay.
